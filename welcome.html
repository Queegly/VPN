		<h1>Welcome to OmniProxy!</h1>
		<h2>Getting Started</h2>
		<p>Simply type 'omni' in Chrome's search bar, then a space, then the URL you want to view. OmniProxy will then open that page for you.</p>
		<p>If OmniProxy makes using the websites you visit difficult or impossible, you can switch to a different proxy in Options. (This shouldn't happen, but just in case, we've got your back.)</p>
