OmniProxy
================
OmniProxy is an extension for Google Chrome that modifies web services to act as proxies for accessing blocked internet content. They don't work perfectly, but are rarely blocked by internet filters. OmniProxy supports using services like Google Translate as proxies, as well as actual web proxy services like Hide.me, ProxyWeb, Anonymouse, and more.

Simply type 'omni' in Chrome's search bar, then a space, then the URL you want to view. If OmniProxy makes using the websites you visit difficult or impossible, you can switch to a different proxy in Options.

**Why does OmniProxy need access to a ton of websites?**

You may notice while installing OmniProxy that it requests access to several websites. Most web proxies inject banners, advertisements, and other elements into pages they load. OmniProxy injects CSS into these pages to remove all the junk the proxy added. The end result is the webpage looking very similar to how it is normally viewed.
